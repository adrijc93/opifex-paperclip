# Adaptive Heartbeat — Paperclip Plugin

Event-driven agent scheduling for [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip). Replaces fixed-interval heartbeats with intelligent, workload-based invocations.

## Problem

Paperclip's default heartbeat runs every agent at a fixed interval (typically 1 hour), regardless of workload. This means:

- An agent with 16 pending issues waits the same as one with 0
- New issue assignments wait up to 1 hour for pickup
- Idle agents waste runs saying "no tasks"
- Backlogs clear slowly even when agents could work faster

## Solution

This plugin makes agent scheduling event-driven:

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Issue assigned to agent | Invoke agent immediately |
| Issue reassigned | Invoke new assignee immediately |
| Agent finishes run, has more work | Re-invoke after 60-120s delay |
| Agent finishes run, backlog clear | Do nothing (agent rests) |
| All subtasks of blocked parent done | Unblock parent, invoke for synthesis |
| Periodic scan (every 2 min) | Catch any missed backlogs |

**Cost impact: Zero or negative.** Eliminates idle heartbeat waste. Only invokes agents that have actual work.

## How It Works

```
Issue Created/Assigned
  └─ Plugin receives event
      └─ Check: agent in cooldown? → skip
      └─ Check: agent paused? → skip
      └─ Check: backlog > 0? → invoke immediately
          └─ Agent runs, completes task
              └─ Plugin receives agent.run.finished
                  └─ Check remaining backlog
                      └─ backlog > 0 → schedule re-invoke (60-120s)
                      └─ backlog = 0 → done, agent rests
```

Debouncing prevents rapid-fire invocations (e.g., 5 issues assigned at once → 1 invocation, not 5).

### Parent Issue Unblocking

When Task Triage decomposes a complex task into subtasks, the parent issue is blocked until all subtasks complete. This plugin detects when the last subtask finishes, automatically unblocks the parent, and invokes the parent's assignee for synthesis — no waiting for the next heartbeat cycle.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | `true` | Master on/off switch |
| Cooldown | `60s` | Min seconds between invocations per agent |
| Backlog Delay | `120s` | Re-invoke delay for 1-2 pending issues |
| Heavy Backlog Delay | `60s` | Re-invoke delay for 3+ pending issues |

## Dashboard Widget
